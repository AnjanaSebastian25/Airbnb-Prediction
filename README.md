Airbnb price  and guest satisfaction prediction in python
This dataset provides information on Airbnb prices in Paris, including room type, cleanliness rating, guest satisfaction score, number of bedrooms, and distance from the city centre. The attributes used in the dataset are room types, cleanliness and satisfaction ratings, bedrooms, distance from the city centre, and more to capture an in-depth understanding of Airbnb prices on weekdays. Using different methods, we analyse and identify the determinants of Airbnb prices across this city. Our dataset includes information such as real Sum (the total price of the listing), room type (private/shared/entire home/apt), host is superhost (boolean value indicating if host is a superhost or not), multi (indicator whether listing is for multiple rooms or not), biz (business indicator) , guest satisfaction overall (overall rating from guests comparing all listings offered by host ), bedrooms, dist (distance from city center) , lng & lat. The Paris data set offers insight into how global markets are affected by social dynamics and geographical factors which in turn determine pricing strategies for optimal profitability and the customer satisfaction in Airbnb.

We want to predict: A. The price of a new listing, and B. The Overall Guest Satisfaction level of this new listing. If AirBnb could predict the overall satisfaction of a new listing, they could promote this listing even before getting reviews from the users.
